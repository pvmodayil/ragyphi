**Summary for Retrieval**

The article presents an AI-based hybrid approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to calculate the characteristic parameters of a single surface microstrip transmission line. The approach uses Thomson's theorem, first-order spline functions, and a scaling reward system to minimize electrostatic energy and optimize potential curve shape. The solution is used to determine transmission line parameters such as impedance (Z) and dielectric constant (ϵ).
