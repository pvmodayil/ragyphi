**1. Concise Summary:**

This document presents a hybrid AI approach using reinforcement learning (RL) and genetic algorithms (GA) to calculate the characteristic parameters of a single surface microstrip transmission line on a printed circuit board (PCB). The solution involves solving the Laplace equation associated with the Q-networks, using first-order spline functions to describe the potential at the boundary layer between two dielectrics. Thomson's theorem is used for this purpose. The authors aim to understand the application of a hybrid algorithm for shape optimization in physics-based problems.
