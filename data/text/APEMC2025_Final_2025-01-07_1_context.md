**1. Concise Summary for Retrieval**

The article presents a hybrid AI approach combining reinforcement learning (RL) and genetic algorithms (GA) to solve a field problem for a single surface microstrip transmission line. The solution uses Thomson's theorem to determine the electrostatic energy W'e and its corresponding potential curve, which is then optimized using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The article aims to demonstrate the application of a hybrid algorithm for shape optimization in physics-based problems.
