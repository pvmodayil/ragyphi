**1. Concise Summary:**

The document presents an AI-based hybrid approach (RL/GA) for calculating the characteristic parameters of a single surface microstrip transmission line. The authors employ Thomson's theorem and use reinforcement learning (DRL) to find the required shape of the potential function, which is then optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). The solution involves two separate calculation steps: determining the unknown series coefficients using first-order spline functions and minimizing the electrostatic energy W'e in the region under consideration.

**2. Key Observations and Relevant Metrics:**

* The authors use Thomson's theorem to describe the potential at the boundary layer between two dielectrics.
* A boundary value problem is defined, where the electric potential on the conductive surface and the conductive boundary of the structure is predetermined, but unknown on the charge-free surface.
* The Laplace equation is solved for the single microstrip arrangement using first-order spline functions to describe the potential at the boundary layer.
* DRL helps achieve a near-global solution initially, which is further optimized using GA.
* The metric behavior (critical/actor loss/entropy coefficient/reward) of the implemented DDRL as a function of training time will be discussed.
